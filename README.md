### Building an IoT Payment and Ordering System

Project Goals:

Streamlined Payments: We are committed to creating a seamless and efficient payment processing system. Our IoT device will provide a hassle-free payment experience for customers, making transactions faster and more convenient.

Enhanced Customer Ordering: The IoT device will also facilitate improved customer ordering, offering intuitive interfaces and features to make placing orders a breeze. We aim to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty through this system.

Data-Driven Insights: Leveraging the power of PostgreSQL, we'll collect valuable transaction and ordering data. This data will enable businesses to gain deeper insights into customer preferences, trends, and purchasing behaviors.

## Key Technologies:

JavaScript enhances the device's functionality, allowing real-time interactions and client-side scripting.

### PostgreSQL: 
Our choice of a powerful relational database system to store and manage transaction and customer data securely.

### "Why IoT?"
IoT technology enables us to connect devices to the internet, transforming them into smart, interconnected solutions. In this project, IoT plays a pivotal role in creating a device that not only processes payments but also collects valuable data to drive business decisions and enhance customer satisfaction.
